Add your answers to the questions below.
For ring buffer the time complexity should be the same the same no matter what the input is. Append only accepts a single value as input.
1. What is the runtime complexity of your ring buffer's `append` method? O(1)
That array is a fixed size so the space complexity depends on what value that is. Assuming the array size is 5 the space complexity should be O(5)
2. What is the space complexity of your ring buffer's `append` function? O(1)

3. What is the runtime complexity of your ring buffer's `get` method? O(1)

4. What is the space complexity of your ring buffer's `get` method? O(n)


5. What is the runtime complexity of the provided code in `names.py`? O(n^2)

6. What is the space complexity of the provided code in `names.py`?
This code ends with 3 arrays name_1, name_2, and duplicates...  O(n^3)? not really sure

7. What is the runtime complexity of your optimized code in `names.py`? Depending on the size of the lists it will take longer. O(List1*list2) O(n^2)

8. What is the space complexity of your optimized code in `names.py` O(n)
